This addon translates a chess game position from FEN code to human friendly description.

ForsythÂ–Edwards Notation (FEN) is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game.

## Usage:

* Select text with a valid FEN code
* Press NVDA+Control+F8 to read description
* Press NVDA+Shift+F8 to read description and copy it to clipboard
* Press NVDA+Control+Shift+F8 to change notation language

Note about notation languages: English notation is standard and usually used in all languages, but local notation language is also used sometimes. I've set english notation by default and I've added other languages optionally
