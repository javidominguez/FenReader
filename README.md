# FEN reader 

This addon translates a chess game position from FEN code to human friendly description.

[Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game.

## Usage:

* Select text with a valid FEN code or copy it in the clipboard
* Press NVDA+Control+F8 to read description

## Settings 
In NVDA preferences > Options > FEN reader you can select this settings:
* Use phonetic alphabet in square names
* Always copy position to clipboard
* Show position in a window

Note about notation languages: English notation is standard and usually used in all languages, but local notation language is also used sometimes. As of version 2.0 it is not necessary to define the notation language, the addon detects it automatically.
