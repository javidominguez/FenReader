## What's new in FEN reader 2.0
  
* The option of naming the squares using the phonetic method has been implemented. It must be activated in the settings.
* In the settings you can configure that the position is always copied to the clipboard. The specific keyboard shortcut for this has been removed.
* The keyboard shortcut for specifying the language of the notation has been removed. It is no longer necessary, now the addon will detect it automatically.
* The possibility of displaying the position in a window has been implemented. To do this, activate the corresponding checkbox in the settings.
* Now the addon is able to get FEN codes directly from the clipboard. In case there are both things, a selected text and a code on the clipboard, the selected text takes precedence and only this will be processed.
